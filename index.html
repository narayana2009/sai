          I am Narayana Murthy, known as Sai by some. This website is dedicated to showcasing my journey. I constructed it using HTML and plan to enhance it as I delve into CSS. Born in my village to my mother, Gayathri, a homemaker, and my father, Kanakarao Gupta, employed at INFOSYS, I've lived in Sholingneluru (TAMIL NADU), Mattapuru (ANDHRAPRADESH), Hyderabad (TELANGANA), and currently reside in Montreal (CANADA).
          
          My childhood friends up to 5-7 grade include Jeshwanth, Vishal, and Snuthik. In 8th grade, my circle expanded to include Anish, Snuthik, Jeshwanth, and Vishal. Now, I've also befriended Samuktha, Detya, and Varshitha among the girls. Currently in 9th grade, my friends include Simran,Tiny, Samuktha, and myself.It's essential to mention that I hold deep respect for girls and appreciate the valuable friendships I've built with Samuktha, Detya, Varshitha, and others
